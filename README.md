# Fulladder
Adds two binary numbers together using a loop that iterates over each digit. It takes in the Swiches as inputs and the Hex display as it's output.<br/>

I used an DE10-Lite for this project.<br/>

Compiled on Quartus Prime 24.1

## How it Works 🚀
- Adds two single digits together and displays its result on the Hex and Remembers a carry out.
- Goes to the next two single digits and does the same thing including the carry out this time.
- Continues until it's all added together and displayed.
